    <h1>The coolest creature: DOGS!!!!</h1>
    <p>
     Dogs are awesome because I have one and he is a cutie patootie. He's a labrador retriever and he's nine years old. And since he's super cool, that means other dogs are cool as well. DUHHHH. They are also very loyal and sweet. They like to stay with you while you use the bathroom because they want to keep you safe. I think that's pretty neat. And they're better than cats but don't tell anyone I said that ðŸ‘€ <strong></strong>.</p>
